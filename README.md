:warning: Screen casting doesn't work with revanced, you will either need to use stock version of the app on your phone or install [SmartTubeNext](https://github.com/yuliskov/SmartTubeNext/releases/latest) on your android TV, it should work with most android-TV smart boxes and it also comes with ad-blocker.

### Requirements:
